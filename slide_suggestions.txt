* slide 9
  - consider using a gender neutral pronoun they/them instead of he/his (done)
* slide 10
  - period after abbreviation for Avg. but not feature name (done)
* slide 11
  - maybe specify that TextBlob was used in the paper we're replicating
    as a justification for choosing this package (done)
* slide 13
  - probably need to include our 4th model (not sure what we ended up doing)
  - looks like it was decision tree classifier (done)
* note
  - may want to include a slide which defines mean squared error (MSE) (done)
    before we start using it in slide 14
* wow, how did the decision tree classifier improve so much? (used two classes only 1 and 5 instead of 1 to 5)
* probably want to be more explicit that we're replicating a paper up 
  front (which one?). I don't think it said anywhere that we did a replication
  and extension which is important for the audience to know.  (can add as a reference in last slide)
