* slide 9
  - consider using a gender neutral pronoun they/them instead of he/his
* slide 10
  - period after abbreviation for Avg. but not feature name
* slide 11
  - maybe specify that TextBlob was used in the paper we're replicating
    as a justification for choosing this package
* slide 13
  - probably need to include our 4th model (not sure what we ended up doing)
  - looks like it was decision tree classifier
* note
  - may want to include a slide which defines mean squared error (MSE)
    before we start using it in slide 14
* wow, how did the decision tree classifier improve so much?
* probably want to be more explicit that we're replicating a paper up 
  front (which one?). I don't think it said anywhere that we did a replication
  and extension which is important for the audience to know.
