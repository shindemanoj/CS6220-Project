## What we plan to do

Our group plans to predict if a project will get funded on Kickstarter.
A dataset containing several attributes over several years on Kickstarter 
project success is freely available on Kaggle. The insight from our 
prediction data about the previous successful projects would be helpful for 
new projects looking for funding on sites like Kickstarter. Our system will 
help new projects to verify their project campaign feasibility or probable 
funding amount before posting it on Kickstarter.

## How we plan to approach it

We plan to use the Kickstarter dataset from Kaggle (1). We anticipate 
using features related to Kickstarter project category, goal amount
quantile, duration of Kickstarter campaign, state and/or country of
Kickstarter project, and number/quality of competitors. The Kickstarter
project dataset fits within 8GB of RAM so no additional computing
resources are required.

## What our final deliverable will be

Our final deliverable will be a classification algorithm which
predicts whether a project will get funded on Kickstarter.
